# OS-Design
Building an OS for funsies and using github as my online resource for sharing &amp; storing my program/code 

First Step: 03/15/16
1. Downloaded VirtualBox and set up 32-Bit Ubuntu on my Mac
2. To my knowledge, downloaded all necessary files including OS, Sublime Text, VIM, dropbox, chrome
3. May need to look into downloading an IDE to help me along the way
4. Updated terminal with necessary libraries including git
5. Created Github account with username kablanian39 
6. Created public repository to store code that must be then cloned into my virtual box OS so that I may store all progress online

Stay Tuned for future updates! And by the way this is me trying out vim since apparently it's built into my terminal. Is this how it's done?
